# earlybird
Early Bird is a bot to help you wake up in the morning. Currently supported platforms are Facebook and Slack.

This bot is currently utilised on a daily basis in a private Slack channel.

I hope to add tests using the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework in the near future. Some refactoring into modules is required before this can be done.
