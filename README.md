# earlybird
Early Bird is a bot to help you wake up in the morning. Just let it know what time you want to wake up and it will send you a message at that time checking if you're awake.

The bot runs on [BotKit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit) and currently supports Facebook and Slack.

I hope to add tests using the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) testing framework in the near future. Some refactoring into modules is required before this can be done.

*Utilised on a daily basis in a private Slack channel.*
